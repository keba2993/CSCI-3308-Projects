2048 - TRIS

  The main focus for this application is to provide a fun challenge for the user. 2048 and Tetris will be played simultaneously using the same key inputs. The user’s goal is to play for high scores against your friends and/or complete strangers! The same key that moves your tetris block right also swipes the 2048 board right, and vice versa! This is also the same for moving left. Rotating a Tetris block swipes the board up and down! We’ve also added a pass move, which quick-drops your tetris block and leaves the 2048 board as is! 
	This is a highly valuable project due to the ingenuity of the design. How many times have you played two games side-by-side, but only using 5 keys for both? Never! And that’s why we have decided to develop this application whose existence was sorely lacking in our universe. The value is in the fun and competitive challenge among peers and against yourself!
